          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Eaton, I am 26 years old and I am an aspiring web developer. I left school in 2012 where I completed a mechanical craft apprenticeship. Fast forward to the present, and I have worked for several companies, produced work for many different industries and worked in a variety of roles. </p>
          <p>In my spare time, I like reading, writing, gaming, programming, cooking and going to the gym. Perhaps DIY isn't a hobby, but I do enjoy it. My partner Olivia and I bought a house in 2022 and I've quickly learnt that there's always jobs that needs doing. Shortly after moving in, we brought home our labrador puppy, Apollo. We plan this year to get on a few big hikes with him, a few trips to the beach, etc... </p>

          <h2>Why web-development?</h2>
          <p> My interest in software began last year, when I wanted to improve efficiency in the department I worked in. I wrote a couple of simple scripts in Python, automated a couple of processes, and the further I delved into the world of software, the more the passion grew. I had been feeling like I was ready for a new career challenge, so I made the decision to actively pursue a software career. After much research, I decided that web development would suit me the most and so I tailored my learning toward this. The front end development is fun because you get to see your work come to life on the web, whilst back end development resonates with me as a mechanical engineer who likes working on the 'engine under the bonnet' so to speak.</p>

        <div class="about-box item-D">
          <h2>Why an apprenticeship?</h2>
          <p>Having completed an apprenticeship already, I know first-hand that apprenticeships are a great way to learn and a great way to tranisition into a new career. I learnt the most in my apprenticeship by working on the job whilst supplementing that with attending college. This style of learning suits me the most.
