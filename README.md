Welcome to my first web development project. I wanted to achieve a couple of outcomes with this project:

Firstly, I needed a good first project that would allow me to develop my CSS and HTML skills. I felt that a simple, 3 page website was a good place to start. By no means has this project made me an expert, but I have learn much about what can be done in CSS, built a solid foundation and aquired the enough knowledge to how and where to look for CSS and HTML issues I encounter in the future. I have tried to implement various features that websites often contain (Grid and Flex for example), whilst being mindful to responsive design, which is a critical when developing a good website. You will find an abundance of comments behind the CSS and HTML code you look at. I don't intend on commenting so much in the future, I just wanted a heavily annotated first project which I can refer back to in the future.

The second outcome - what better way is there to tell potential employers in the web development world about me than a website all about me? Of course my CV contains some of the information found on the website, but I think further information about my hobbies, motivations, plus a nice image gallery and demonstration of my current skills do go a long way in painting a picture of who I am and what I can offer potential employers.

Thanks for reading! I do hope you enjoy my first project. Please do provide feedback, there is undoubtedly room for improvement.
